{assignment_verdict}

**Authors:** [@github-handle-1, @github-handle-2 — or `Name <email>` when no GitHub handle is known, comma-separated in commit order; never the agent / CR identity]
**Available behind:** [optional — present only when the change is reachable only behind a test parameter; name the toggle (e.g. `config('feature.new_pricing')`, ENV `BETA_PRICING=1`, query `?preview=1`, admin switch *New pricing preview*) and the value required to reach it; omit this line entirely when the change is reachable unconditionally]

## Summary of changes

**[Short headline naming the change — one line, terse]**

[Terse paragraph — 1–3 short sentences or fragments: business reason, affected area, just enough technical context (integration, payload, table, endpoint, …) to locate the change without reading the diff. No filler, no hedging, drop articles where the language has them; all substance stays. Phrase impersonally — never first person.]

## How to test

1. [If *Available behind* is set, this step **must** enable the toggle / supply the parameter / switch the admin flag — naming the exact value]
2. [Next action the tester performs — short imperative, no filler; exact names / values / URLs verbatim]
3. [Outcome the tester verifies — terse but complete; keep every word needed for unambiguous verification]

<!-- ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
     TEMPLATE GUIDANCE — never part of the published comment.

     Everything above this marker is the comment body. Everything below it is an
     HTML comment: GitHub renders nothing for it, so it cannot reach a reader even
     if the whole file is copied into a comment by mistake. Keep it that way — a
     blockquote (`>`) would render as a visible, official-looking quotation, which
     is exactly how meta-instructions leak unnoticed.

     {embedded_blocks}
       Render this slot only when the calling CR wrapper passes one or more markdown
       blocks (typically the `## Assignment Compliance` block returned by
       `@skills/assignment-compliance-check/SKILL.md`). Each block is appended
       verbatim, in the order received, separated by a single blank line. When no
       blocks are passed, omit this slot entirely — including the surrounding blank
       lines — so the comment ends right after `How to test`.

     {assignment_verdict}
       Render this slot at the very top only when the calling CR wrapper passes an
       `## Assignment Compliance` block — i.e. the changes do not satisfy the
       assignment. It is a single bold line in the assignment language stating
       non-compliance and the gap count `N` (taken from the block's
       `Critical gaps found: N` verdict / count of gap entries), pointing the reader
       to the detail below — e.g.
       `⚠️ **Changes do not satisfy the assignment — N gap(s). See Assignment Compliance below.**`
       (Czech assignment → `⚠️ **Změny nesplňují zadání — N nedostatk(ů). Viz Assignment Compliance níže.**`).

       When the changes satisfy the assignment (no Assignment Compliance block
       passed) or no tracker is linked, omit this slot entirely — including the
       surrounding blank line — so the comment begins at `Authors`. Never render a
       positive "satisfies the assignment" line; only non-compliance is surfaced.

     The canonical statement of both rules lives in `@skills/pr-summary/SKILL.md`
     (*Embedded blocks* and *Assignment non-compliance verdict (top banner)*). This
     block restates the slot mechanics for whoever is filling the template in; the
     skill is the source of truth if the two ever disagree.
